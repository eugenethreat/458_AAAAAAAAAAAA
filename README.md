My final project for MUSIC 458 - Electronic Music Composition 

This piece is titled: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA". The goal is for the performer to reflect on how technology has affected them during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can watch a video of me performing the piece here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CgfxMSsF4

There are a few different bits of code

--Android app - listens for notifications to modify frequency of sine tones 

--SuperCollider - plays a sine wave that increases in frequency as you get more notifications or pings on your phone 

--JavaScript server - listens for notifications from the phone. When a notification is recieved, sends an OSC message to SuperCollider to increase the frequency of the sine tones. 

--along with a backing track
