My final project for MUSIC 458 - Electronic Music Composition 

This piece is titled: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA". The goal is for the performer to reflect on how technology has affected them during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can watch a vide of me performing the piece here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CgfxMSsF4
