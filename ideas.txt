idea - "my digital life" 

instrument -- phone 
performer plugs their phone into aux jack, sets notification volume to max 
(text to speech reading notifications) 
(more notifications == higher pitched and louder drone) 

performer screams/makes noises as they feel (stockhausen) 


THINGS TO RESEARCH 
-Supercollider and python -- can you work with live input/python code?
-android text to speech for alert pings

tape -- covid alerts or stats or something idk

workflow: 

android app has a component that listens for notifications + 
when there is a new notificaiton, send something to the server 
//how do I go about doing this? 
//when your phone gets a notif, send an http request and run a function on the server 

server then tells supercollider to raise frequency by 1 +
