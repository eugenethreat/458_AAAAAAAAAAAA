  * Create a new synth.

  Create a new synth from a named, compiled and already loaded synth definition, give it an ID, and add it to the tree of nodes.

  There are four ways to add the node to the tree as determined by the add action argument

  Controls may be set when creating the synth. The control arguments are the same as for the `n_set` command.

  If you send `/s_new` with a synth ID of -1, then the server will generate an ID for you. The server reserves all negative IDs. Since you don't know what the ID is, you cannot talk to this node directly later. So this is useful for nodes that are of finite duration and that get the control information they need from arguments and buses or messages directed to their group. In addition no notifications are sent when there are changes of state for this node, such as `/n_go`, `/n_end`, `/n_on`, `/n_off`.

  If you use a node ID of -1 for any other command, such as `/n_map`, then it refers to the most recently created node by `/s_new` (auto generated ID or not). This is how you can map  the controls of a node with an auto generated ID. In a multi-client situation, the only way you can be sure what node -1 refers to is to put the messages in a bundle.

  This message now supports array type tags (`$[` and `$]`) in the control/value component of the OSC message.  Arrayed control values are applied in the manner of n_setn (i.e., sequentially starting at the indexed or named control). See the linkGuides/NodeMessaging helpfile.
